# GuessGame
A guessing game built w/ HTML, CSS &amp; vanilla JS

The animal images were obtained from the following link:

I originally designed the game for a classroom teacher who asked for something that was customisable for their students. The colour scheme passes the WCAG accessibility contrast checker.
